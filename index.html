      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring software engineer with strong interest in front end web development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Orlando, FL, USA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Reading mystery novels, going to the beach or to the pool, listening to vinyl records, rollerskating, playing video games, drinking boba tea, and snuggling with my cat.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream is to be a web developer for Apple. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Technically Davenport, but I still conside Orlando my stomping ground</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>When I was in high school, I went to private school with majors of study and I was in Tech. I enjoyed learning basic HTML/CSS, video editing, stage lighting and sound, etc. However, in college, I impulsively changed course to Writing and Rhetoric. And despite being hotter by one degree, I was unable to find a job in the field. Since I was sick of working lousy paying customer service jobs that I hated, I decided to revert back to my roots and persue a career in tech. Web development is something that will a.) satisfy my desire to create and problem solve, and b.) provide financial security that I've always wanted. </p>
